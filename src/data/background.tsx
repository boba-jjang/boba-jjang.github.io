        I began my Computer Engineering journey as an undergraduate at the{" "}
        <strong>University of South Florida</strong>, where I later continued
        directly into a Master’s program under{" "}

        . After completing my M.S. in 2015, I followed Dr. Ghosh to{" "}
        <strong>Penn State University</strong> to pursue a Ph.D.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few years into the program, I found myself struggling—both physically
        and mentally. The cumulative pressure of research, teaching, and
        preparing for the qualifier exam took a toll, and I ultimately decided
        to step away from the Ph.D. program. This decision was not the result of
        external circumstances or anyone else’s fault. Instead, it came from my
        own realization that I had underestimated what the Ph.D. journey truly
        demands.
      </p>

      <p>
        After leaving the program, I spent a year working in industry. During
        that time, I reflected on what I wanted long-term. Despite the
        opportunity cost—especially given that{" "}
        <strong>2018 was a peak hiring period for FAANG and similar companies</strong>, I realized that if I did not try again, I might never have another
        chance. Therefore, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. once more.
      </p>

        I joined the{" "}

        , whom I consider one of the most influential mentors in my life. Under
        his mentorship, I learned not only how to conduct rigorous research, but
        also how to approach challenges in life with perspective and resilience.
        After six years, I earned my{" "}
        <strong>Ph.D. in Computer Engineering in 2024</strong>.

        The reason I share this story is tied to something more personal. Recently, I
        watched <em>Culinary Class Wars Season 2</em> (흑백요리사 2), where my favorite
        chef, <strong>Choi Kang Rok (최강록)</strong>, competed—and won. I was initially
        uninterested in the show, but learning that he had returned to compete again
        caught my attention, as I never expected him to do so. After watching the
        show, what ultimately inspired me to share my own background was his final
        remark:
        </p>

        <p className="italic">
        “재도전해서 좋았다” —{" "}
        <span className="not-italic">“It was good to try again.”</span>
        </p>

        <p>
        That statement resonated deeply with me and reflected how I feel about my own
        decision to return and try again.
        </p>

        <p>There are two lessons I hope to convey through my experience:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>
            <strong>Trying again is not a failure.</strong> Recognizing when something is
            not working, stepping away, and returning with clarity is a form of
            resilience. It is better to retry and risk regret than to never try again
            and live with unanswered “what ifs.”
        </li>
        <li>
            To me, <strong>Ph.D.</strong> does not stand for intelligence. It stands for{" "}
            <strong>P</strong>erseverance, <strong>H</strong>ard work, and{" "}
            <strong>D</strong>edication. Success in a Ph.D. requires patience, luck, the
            right guidance, and—above all—the willingness to keep going even when things
            feel overwhelming.
        </li>
        </ul>
